# Java-GUI-earthquake-visualization-project

This repository contains the programming assignments I have completed in Coursera course [Object Oriented Programming in Java](https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java). 

In this Java GUI project I have programmed in Eclipse using [Unfolding Maps](http://unfoldingmaps.org/javadoc/) and [Processing](https://processing.org/reference/) libraries. The following functions are implemented:

* Read live RSS earthquake data on [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/) and visualize them on Google Maps 
* Create features/methods for classes of earthquake/city/marker...
* Mark the earthquakes on the map with different shape/color to differentiate their depth/location
* Build event handlers to respond to graphical user input
* Display airport locations and life expectancy of each country on the map


I find this project is a very good practice of object oriented programming as well as data structure, because during this project I was always using classes, heritance, polymorphism, overriding, overloading, lists, arrays, memory models, etc.

Here is a photo of the effect of this GUI (earthquake data visualization)
