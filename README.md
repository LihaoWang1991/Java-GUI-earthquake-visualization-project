# Java-GUI-earthquake-visualization-project

This repository contains the programming assignments I have completed in Coursera course [Object Oriented Programming in Java](https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java). 

In this Java GUI project I have programmed in Eclipse using [Unfolding Maps](http://unfoldingmaps.org/javadoc/) and [Processing](https://processing.org/reference/) libraries. The following functions are implemented:

* Connect to Google Maps and display the maps in GUI
* Mark the earthquake points with different size/form to differentiate their magnitude/date on Google world map 
* Build event handlers to respond to graphical user input
